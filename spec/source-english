VERSE 2
Room in the Savior's bleeding heart;
There love and pity meet;
Nor will he bid the soul depart,
That trembles at his feet.
In him the Father reconciled
Invites your souls to come;
The rebel shall be called a child,
And kindly welcomed home.

VERSE 3
Oh, come, and with his children taste
The blessings of his love;
While hope attends the sweet repast
Of nobler joys above.
There, with united heart and voice,
Before th'eternal throne,
Ten thousand thousand souls rejoice,
In ecstasies unknown.
