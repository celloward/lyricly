Purpose: Automate the hyphenation of lyrics in Early New High German and placement into lilypond template as lyrics.
Needs:
  + Hyphenation API for Modern German
  * A way to apply API to ENHG
  * A Lilypond file with ERB lines to act as template
  * An interface to easily run program on a text file 
    * Bash interface e.g. `lyricly <source.txt> <template.erb.ly>` => filled in template file with all verses ly hyphenated.
    * Flags for skipping verses (-s) and setting verses as markup verses (-c for column)

TODO
  * Research APIs
  * Research available ENHG dictionaries
  * Create erb/ly file
  * Create interface with erb/ly file to set indeterminate number of lines in.
