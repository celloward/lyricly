VERSE 1
Gilderoy was a bonny boy,
Had roses till his shoon;
His stockings were of silken soy,
Wi garters hanging doun.
It was, I ween, a comelie sight
To see sae trim a boy:
He was my joy, and heart's delight,
My handsome Gilderoy.

VERSE 2
O sic twa charming een he had!
Breath sweet as ony rose:
He never ware a highland plaid,
But costly silken clothes.
He gain'd the luve of ladies gay,
Nane eer to him was coy:
Ah wae is me, I mourn the day
For my dear Gilderoy.

VERSE 3
My Gilderoy and I were born
Baith in ae toun together;
We scant were seven years beforn
We gan to luve ilk ither:
Our dadies and our mamies thay
Were fill'd wi mikle joy,
To think upon the bridal day
Of me and Gilderoy.

VERSE 4
For Gilderoy, that luve of mine
Gude faith, I freely bought
A wedding sark of Holland fine,
Wi dainty ruffles wroght;
And he gied me a wedding ring
Which I receiv'd wi joy:
Nae lad nor lassie eer could sing
Like me and Gilderoy.

VERSE 5
Wi mickle joy we spent our prime
Till we were baith sixteen,
And aft we past the langsame time
Amang the leaves sae green:
Aft on the banks we'd sit us thair,
And sweetly kiss and toy;
While he wi garlands deck'd my hair,
My handsome Gilderoy.

VERSE 6
Oh that he still had been content
Wi me to lead his life!
But, ah, his manfu heart was bent
To stir in feats of strife.
And he in many a venturous deed
His courage bauld wad try;
And now this gars my heart to bleed
For my dear Gilderoy.

VERSE 7
And when of me his leave he tuik,
The tears they wat mine ee:
I gied him sic a parting luik!
"My benison gang wi thee!
God speed thee weil mine ain dear heart,
For gane is all my joy;
My heart is rent, sith we maun part,
My handsome Gilderoy."

VERSE 8
My Gilderoy, baith far and near
Was fear'd in every toun;
And bauldly bare awa the geir,
Of mony a lawland loun.
For man to man durst meet him nane,
He was sae brave a boy;
At length wi numbers he was tane,
My winsome Gilderoy.

VERSE 9
Wae worth the louns that made the laws
To hang a man for gear;
To reave of life for sic a cause
As stealing horse or mare!
Had not their laws been made sae strick
I neer had lost my joy;
Wi sorrow neer had wat my cheek
For my dear Gilderoy.

VERSE 10
Gif Gilderoy had done amiss,
He mought hae banisht been;--
Ah what fair cruelty is this,
To hang sic handsome men!
To hang the flower o Scotish land,
Sae sweet and fair a boy:--
Nae lady had sae white a hand
As thee, dear Gilderoy.

VERSE 11
Of Gilderoy sae fear'd they were,
Wi irons his limbs they strung;
To Edinborow led him thair,
And on a gallows hung.
They hung him high aboon the rest,
He was sae bauld a boy;
Thair dyed the youth wham I lued best,
My handsome Gideroy.

VERSE 12
Sune as he yielded up his breath
I bare his corse away,
Wi tears, that trickled for his death,
I wash'd his comlie clay;
And siker in a grave right deep
I laid the dear lued boy:
And now for ever I maun weep,
My winsome Gilderoy.
